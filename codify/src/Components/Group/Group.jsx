        We believe that one of the most valuable aspects of any community
        is user generated content. More importantly user generated content
        that helps the community foster and grow. WHE Metaverse is an
        interactive 3D universe based in space, with the freedom to
        explore different virtual worlds and communities, it is not
        necessarily a game in and of itself. It can instead best be
        described as a hub for virtual social interaction and expression,
        and trading and collecting assets within a digital economy, and
        our WHE Club is the key to unlocking this world. WHE Club NFTs is
        a limited collection of unique, programmatically generated NFTs
        hosted on the Polygon blockchain. Each WHE is unique â€“ just like
        you and programmatically generated from over 200 possible traits,
        including clothing, city background, expression and more.
