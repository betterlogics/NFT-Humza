                    <p>
                        We believe that one of the most valuable aspects of any community is user generated content. More
                        importantly user generated content that helps the community foster and grow. WHE Metaverse is an
                        interactive 3D universe based in space, with the freedom to explore different virtual worlds and
                        communities, it is not necessarily a game in and of itself. It can instead best be described as a
                        hub
                        for virtual social interaction and expression, and trading and collecting assets within a digital
                        economy, and our WHE Club is the key to unlocking this world. WHE Club NFTs is a limited collection
                        of
                        unique, programmatically generated NFTs hosted on the Polygon blockchain. Each WHE is unique – just
                        like
                        you and programmatically generated from over 200 possible traits, including clothing, city
                        background,
                        expression and more.</p>
